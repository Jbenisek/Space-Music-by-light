🎧 Broadcasting and Detecting Music via Light in Deep Space

A Conceptual Framework for Sonifying Redshifted Light as Interstellar Audio

📡 The Core Idea

Because sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space, any attempt to transmit music or rhythmic communication across interstellar distances must use electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio. The concept explored here is to encode audio signals into modulated light, transmit them across space, and then reconstruct the original music signal by reversing redshift and time dilation effects experienced over cosmic distances.

🔁 Transmission Method

Amplitude Modulation (AM-style): Audio signals are embedded into the intensity of a light beam (or narrowband radio).

Carrier Frequency: Ideally centered around the 1.42 GHz hydrogen line — a universal reference frequency.

Time Compression: To preserve more information, signals might be transmitted at very high speed and pitch, with the expectation that they will be naturally stretched by redshift and cosmic expansion.

🧠 Alien Intention Hypothesis

A sufficiently advanced civilization might intentionally:

Transmit looped or redundant musical structures

Use AM-style encoding over cosmic beacon frequencies

Exploit redshift by sending compressed, high-frequency music that naturally slows and lowers in pitch en route

🔬 Detection and Reconstruction

On the receiving side, terrestrial or near-Earth detectors might unknowingly capture these signals as:

Long, noisy, unstructured waveforms
(e.g., cosmic static, fast radio bursts, light curves)

To extract potential music:

Reverse redshift by resampling the signal (compressing time and restoring frequency).

Demodulate the waveform to recover the original envelope.

Sonify the resulting audio to detect rhythm, patterns, or structure.

🚀 Practical Experimentation

This idea was tested using simulated AM-encoded audio stretched over a 10× redshift. Reconstruction was successful, yielding a playable WAV file with clean rhythmic structure. Attempts to apply this to real astronomical light data (e.g., from Kepler or TESS) revealed challenges due to:

Sparse sampling rates

Short timeframes

Insufficient data resolution for audio fidelity

🌌 Future Work

To truly test this idea, we need access to:

High-cadence, long-duration light recordings (e.g., from TESS 2s mode, CHIME, or raw photon arrival time series)

Custom pipelines for automated redshift compensation and signal demodulation

Exploratory listening techniques for alien musical structure detection

This concept bridges astrophysics, SETI, and music — asking not just "Are we alone?" but also "What might they be broadcasting, and could it sound beautiful?" 🎶
